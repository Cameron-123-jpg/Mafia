# ðŸŽ­ Mafia (Terminal Edition)

A terminal-based recreation of the classic party game **Mafia** (also known as Werewolf), written in Java.  
This is the first version of the project â€” designed for **local, pass-the-laptop play**.  

Future plans include scaling into a full **multiplayer web version** with Spring Boot + JavaScript. ðŸš€

## Notes
This is the **first draft** of the Mafia project â€” itâ€™s not perfect.  
Iâ€™ll continue improving it and eventually develop a **full web version** so players can connect online.  
Stay tuned for updates!
